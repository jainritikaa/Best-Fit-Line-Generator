This project implements a Best Fit Line Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It calculates the slope and intercept of a line that best fits a set of given coordinates using the Least Squares Method.

## Features

- Input multiple coordinates as comma-separated values (e.g., `x1,y1; x2,y2; x3,y3`).
- Calculates the slope and intercept of the best fit line.
- Renders the line on an HTML canvas.
